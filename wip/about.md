    <h1>About Us</h1>

    We’re building the leading platform that empowers companies to build digital applications for lean and sustainable manufacturing.

    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    Today’s companies generate more data than ever, but most aren’t able to use that information to run their business more profitably or sustainably.  Data is     siloed, insights are topical, actions are slow to be put in motion, and impact is hard to quantify.
    We want to change that. 
    That’s why we built Zira
    We believe that by providing tools to build better digital applications faster we can help organizations use data to optimize and enforce profitable and sustainable business processes.

    <h1>How it all started?</h1>
    We emerged from a large scale industrial research project by UC Berkeley, MIT, and the University of Chicago.
