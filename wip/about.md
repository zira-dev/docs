    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>We are on a mission to help manufacturers grow faster.</h2>
    <h3>We believe that by providing tools to build better digital applications faster we can help organizations use data to optimize and enforce profitable and sustainable business processes.</h3>
    <h1>How it all started?</h1>
    Manufacturers need to get lean to stay competitive and they can save resources while they do it.
    We emerged from a large scale industrial research project by UC Berkeley, MIT, and the University of Chicago.
    The research aimed at understanding how data and analytics can help industrial manufacturers save resources (specificaly energy).  Zira (then called lightapp)       was deployed in more than 100 plants from all industrial verticals.
    The results were clear, we were able to save manufacturers hundreds of thousands of dollars and cut just as many tons of carbon emissions in the process.
    You can learn more about the project by <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/publications/2019/unlocking-industrial-energy-efficiency-through-optimized-energy-management">clicking here</a>.

Moving forward, we think we can do even better.
    <h1>Some say we're in a new Industrial Revolution. We just think it's a good time to get ahead.</h1>
When you can increase the lifespan of your machines, prevent downtime, and create more product with the same equipment, you manufacture smarter than the competition.
