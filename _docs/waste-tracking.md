Optimizing process steps to eliminate waste makes sure that real value is being added during each phase of the production cycle, and translates directly to controlling direct and indirect costs.

##### **The Top 3 Waste Costs Customers Reduce with Zira**

1. **Raw Materials:** Scraps and defective products are wasted raw material that cannot be sold or generate revenue
2. **Direct Labor:** Time spent by employees operating machines generating waste is not time well spent.
3. **Utilities:** 100% of energy used by machines to product defective product or scrap is waste

## **Getting Started with Paperless or Real Time Waste Tracking**

You can start managing waste better with Zira regardless of how basic or advanced your existing waste tracking process is.

For those that have a paper driven waste tracking process, we suggest to start by digitizing your waste tracking forms with our digital form builder. Using digital waste forms instantly makes data accessible, impossible to misplace, and available to feed automated reports and triggers that engage waste managers and operators the moment a problem occurs or negative trend is developing.

If waste data is being tracked through a machine PLC, ERP, MES, or external database, it can be connected to Zira via integration or API. If you need assistance deciding on the best way to connect your data or help choosing and installing a sensor for real time tracking, you can consult directly with a Zira engineer for recommendations based on your specific setup. Customers add real time waste data to Zira so it can easily be accessed by teams to make data driven decisions and automate processes such as assigning employees work or deploying funds to improve wasteful processes.
