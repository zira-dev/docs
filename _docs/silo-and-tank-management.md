It is common for businesses to store raw materials like flour or caustic soda in a silo or tank. It is unfortunately just as common for businesses to lack systems for tracking and reordering those materials, which can lead to unplanned downtime and operational chaos.

Zira tools enable procurement and supply chain professionals to bring their operations to the 21st century by digitizing tracking forms or transitioning to fully automated data collection and predictive procurement. The are a variety of benefits and opportunities this transformation makes possible for a business. These are some of the most notable.

##### **Visibility and Accessibility**

No more climbing up silos or scrambling on top of tanks to know what you have. Anyone can quickly and safely access the most up-to-date silo and tank levels with a quick search on Zira or by scanning a QR code in the field.

##### **Act “Just in time”**

Zira makes sure you never run out of the materials needed to keep your business running. Setting triggers to send real time alerts by push notification or email engages procurement teams and suppliers exactly when they are needed, giving your teams peace of mind and the bandwidth to focus on other responsibilities.

##### **Optimize Delivery Schedules**

In addition to current tank level, Zira predictive procurement engines take into consideration consumption rates and scheduled production runs so you only pay for delivery when it is needed.

##### **Predictive Procurement**

By integrating Zira to procurement systems like SAP or Oracle, you can completely automate the procurement process based on level data that is gathered manually by team members or collected from a level sensor.

##### **Grow Your Business**

Connect with new suppliers in the Zira network to receive competitive pricing, (or list your own products on the Zira marketplace to increase your own sales opportunities.)

## Getting started

Managing material levels in a tank or silo is easy to do with Zira, and you can start reaping the benefits in minutes with no capital expenditure. If you already have a manual collection process in place, start by digitizing the form or checklist so information that employees collect is instantly available on Zira. Reports, triggers, and analysis tools can still be leveraged with manually collected data, as can procurement automations.

If you want to completely eliminate employee touch points, connect existing level sensors as a data source on Zira, or install a new device. If you do not have a sensor and are unsure which you should purchase, contact Zira to be put in touch with an engineer or partner that will help you make the best decision based on your application.
