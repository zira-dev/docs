Compressed air systems are used in practically all manufacturing and process industries. It is a critical utility whose operations are closely monitored by production and maintenance professionals alike because of the strong correlation to plant uptime, product quality, and energy costs. By enabling teams to access realtime insights and automatically generate compressor maintenance actions, teams can easily reduce energy costs, increase machine lifetime, eliminate unplanned downtime, and optimally allocate resources for system upgrades or replacement.

## **The data**

The most important data to understand how a compressed air system is operating is power consumption, system pressure, and total airflow. Zira can collect this data by connecting directly to a compressor PLC, SCADA, or external meters and sensors. This data can also be collected manually via a digital form. It is also recommended to digitize compressor startup checklists and PMs. This maintenance and operational data is key for generating an end-to-end understanding of system performance.

## **Key insights and automations**

##### **Activation Logic**

Power data allows you to determine the activation logic of your compressed air system- how compressors are staged to work together. Simple but quick adjustments to pressure setpoints on your machines can be made that reduce idle time, and Off/idle/start cycles of the machine.

##### **Leakage**

Flow data is critical for understanding system demand, identifying leakage, and calculating an ROI on fixes.

##### **Overall Efficiency**

Using power and flow data, you can create an efficiency indicator- kWh/100cfm- which denotes how much energy your compressed air system requires to generate a set unit of air. A healthy compressed air system should sit around 22kWh/100cfm. The overall system efficiency can be impacted by activation logic of the compressors, and whether or not adequate maintenance has been performed on the machine.

##### **Maintenance and PMâ€™s**

Over time compressors and piping takes a beating. The impact may be gradual and is often ignored because information gathered during daily checks is stuck on paper. Digital checklists enable teams to set triggers so that negative trends and warning signs documented in the field automatically create tasks for maintenance technicians. Acting the moment a motor shows signs of failure, or pressure is too low, or leakage gets out of hand means no unplanned downtime, less energy consumption, and uninterrupted operations.
