They say quality is king, and we agree. How much you produce means nothing if the product is poor or out of spec, which is why businesses use Zira to put their quality teams in control of yield and compliance.

##### **Save time and make quality data accessible.**

The quality management process on Zira is completely paperless, which ensures unparalleled access to critical quality data. Quality forms and checklists can be securely accessed and submitted from any device, including phone, tablet, PC, or workstation. No paper means no more transcription to excel, and unlimited history means your data records are always safe and accessible to view or export when they are needed internally or for 3rd party audits.

##### **Increase regulatory compliance**

Product quality parameters are automatically referenced on any form submission so appropriate team members are notified in real time the moment a quality check or audit is submitted with a failure or non-conformance issue. Details including the form name, time submitted, person submitting, trigger reason, and additional comments are included. Triggers can also be used to automatically create and assign tasks to quality team members.

##### **Reduce waste, work, and product returns.**

It is common for quality teams to create a quality management channel on Zira that acts as centralized repository for quality rooted communication, collaboration, and problem solving. When everything quality, from automated reports to triggers to conversations, can be found and searched for in the same place, teams are able to stay on top of issues and resolve them faster, resulting in a decreased waste of raw materials, decreased re-work time, and fewer complaints and returns from customers.
