Energy management is more important than ever for a business to be profitable, sustainable, and looked at favorably by customers and employees who value corporate social responsibility. Investing in an EMS system does more than help you cut direct energy consumption and forecast operational costs. The same data can be used to generate insights that help decision makers efficiently deploy resources based on day-to-day and long term operational trends.

##### **Cut energy costs, today and in the future.**

Lighting fast data collection, analysis, and visualization of energy data gives everyone a clear picture of how, when and where energy is being used. Zira automatically calculates baseline energy consumption by machine or department, allowing you to compare your current performance to historic norms and Zira industry benchmarks. Use your energy data to forecast demand and make strategic, cost saving energy sourcing decisions that align with your business objectives and financial flexibility.

##### **Automate so you have time for energy.**

Donâ€™t worry if you cannot look at your energy data every day. Automated energy reports will keep you up to data with the most important KPIs and triggers can be set that direct you to immediate and long term problems so your time is spent making decisions based on the data, not searching for problems.

##### **Optimize maintenance operations to eradicate unplanned downtime.** 

Zira specializes in collecting energy data, including kW, voltage, amperage, and power factor data that can provide valuable insights into motor health and failure probability. In addition to running basic preventive maintenance operations, Zira helps customers automatically trigger alerts and create maintenance tasks based on these parameters so that unplanned downtime can be prevented before a critical failure occurs. Proactively fixing energy related problems leads to a direct reduction in energy consumption, reduced operational costs, and extends equipment lifetime without extensive capital expenditures.

##### **Invest based on ROI, not your gut.**

A time will come when you need to repair, retrofit, or completely replace a machine, and energy data can help you make the best, most cost effective decision.

# **Getting started**

Customers can connect real time or manually collected energy data to Zira. We recommend using real time energy data to create better insights and identify the most valuable opportunities, but making manually collected energy data accessible and actionable also carries significant benefits.

To connect real time data, Zira has a variety of prebuilt drivers that allow you to quickly connect or integrate with an existing PLC, database, historian, or sensor with energy data. Many utility companies also have open APIs that allow customers to share their interval energy data with 3rd parties such as Zira. If you do not have real time data or an energy meter in place, you can purchase a preconfigured meter directly through Zira.

If you have a manual energy data collection process, this data can be uploaded to Zira from an excel file, or you can create a digital form for data collection so that data is instantaneously available in Zira without any additional actions.
