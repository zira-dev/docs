Machine downtime can break a business. Raw materials and operators sit idle, and lack of production can have cascading negative impacts on other business departments including production, shipping, and maintenance. It’s no wonder that 90% of general managers agree that the best way to increase profitability is to decrease downtime. So why do our customers love to track downtime on Zira? 

Providing employees with a quick and easy way to track and categorize downtime means operators and management both have critical operational data that helps them do their jobs better. Operators can see their current and historic performance levels, and managers can make informed decisions and investments to maximize uptime and plant productivity. Zira is guaranteed to help you ask the following downtime questions:

##### **How much downtime do we have?**

This is the most rudimentary question you will be able to answer when tracking downtime on Zira. In clicks you will be able to assess performance for any time period, visualizing stop time vs run time by machine, operator, or department. Performance benchmarks and goals can be created based on downtime data alone, or combined with production and quality data to automatically calculate OEE and other KPIs.

##### **Why do we have downtime?**

It isn’t enough just to know that you have downtime, or even how much. You need to focus on is why you have downtime, because these are the problems that need to be tackled to improve. Does a particular machine keep shutting down because of a recurring maintenance issue? Is the operator waiting on a forklift to move finished goods out of the way or raw material to be delivered? How does downtime reason vary by operator and shift? Categorization of downtime lets you conduct root cause analysis and respond with precision.

##### **Which downtime problem should I tackle?**

Successful businesses make investments based on the overall return to the business. You can take your downtime tracking to the next level by assigning values to different downtime categories, and making investment and training decisions based on the savings that will be incurred. For example, if the machines in a particular department commonly experience downtime because they are waiting for a forklift, it might make sense to hire another driver. If a particular operator is consistently missing the mark, it might make sense to talk with and retrain that person.

If you want to take your downtime tracking to the next level using Zira you can acquire data in two ways:

1. **_Digital forms:_** When downtime data doesn’t exist, the simplest, fastest, and cheapest way to track downtime is with a digital form. Similar to other digital forms on Zira, a downtime tracking form can be accessed by scanning a QR code or clicking the form directly from an operator panel in Zira. The most basic downtime tracking forms will ask whether they operator is starting or stopping the machine, and the reason. Every time the form is submitted, a timer categorizes the time that has elapsed and automatically makes it available on Zira for analysis. If you have legacy equipment without downtime data, this will be the best option for you.
2. **_Integration or automatic data upload:_** If downtime data for the machine is already tracked and digitized, it can automatically be uploaded to Zira and made available as a data source. Zira has the ability to integrate to machine PLC and collect data via an API. You can learn more about integrating data to Zira here, or work with a Zira representative to determine the best solution for your particular situation.

Although downtime tracking is simple to setup and the data points can appear mundane, the insights and value they provide are anything but.
