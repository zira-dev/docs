Manufacturers exist to build products, which is why understanding the production throughput of individual machines, departments, and the overall operation is key to success. By connecting to real time production data from machines or production data gathered manually by operators, Zira enables the efficient and accurate tracking required to run production operations better.

##### **Enable accessibility**

With Zira, production data isn’t stuck on a piece of paper that can be lost or siloed in a machine controller or database. It is available in clicks for anyone to view through dashboards or automated reports. When production operators and managers can easily access data and insights, they can make adjustments and smarter decisions that increase productivity.

##### **Boost your OEE**

Combining production, runtime, and quality data lets you calculate OEE by line, department, shift, or plant. By comparing actual, baseline, and target OEE, you can identify and direct resources to the machines and operators that will benefit the most from maintenance or training.

##### **Generate NEW Performance KPIs**

Overlay production data with plant energy and operational data to create new performance KPI’s that give advanced insight into the way your business is performing.

##### **Take action and save**

Use Zira to set triggers that automatically notify operators and supervisors when production parameters fall outside of statistical process control guidelines (SPC). Adjusting machine setpoints or starting maintenance the moment throughput slows or quality is off can prevent enormous losses by eliminating raw material waste, product returns, and the opportunity cost of lost runtime.

## **Paperless and Real Time Production Tracking**

For those that have manual, paper driven processes for collecting production data, we suggest to start by digitizing your forms with our digital form builder. Transitioning to digital forms bring instantaneous, tangible value with no capital expenditure required. Data immediately becomes accessible, is impossible to misplace, and can be used to feed automated reports and triggers that engage operators, maintenance teams, and management the moment a problem or trend merits attention.

If you already have production data being tracked through a machine PLC, ERP, MES, or external database, it can be connected to Zira via integration or API. If you need assistance deciding on the best way to connect your data or help choosing and installing a sensor for real time tracking, you can consult directly with a Zira engineer for recommendations based on your specific setup.
