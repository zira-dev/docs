Does inventory give you a headache? Don’t know how many spare parts are on hand or materials in the warehouse? Teams not counting inventory often enough? Inventory management is key to running a successful business and making sure production is running, but the processes most businesses follow have managers reaching for aspirin, until Zira.

Zira enables supply chain, maintenance, and operations leaders to rest easy knowing exactly what supplies they have on hand, when they need to be replenished, and where they should buy them.

##### **Accessibility**

It all starts with digital forms, which gives teams the ability to record inventory in the field using a phone, tablet or computer. With Zira, inventory data isn’t stuck on a piece of paper, never gets lost or misplaced, and employees don’t have to decipher and re-transcribe information into excel or ERP systems. Better yet, the moment data is submitted is is accessible for anyone with the right permissions and automatically visualized to identify opportunities.

##### **Just in time procurement**

Beyond accessibility, teams now can use the reporting and trigger tools available on Zira to automatically generate up-to-date inventory reports and notify procurement teams or suppliers the moment an inventory level becomes problematic. Real time push notifications and emails give teams a peace of mind and the bandwidth to focus on other, often times more complex responsibilities and problem solving.

##### **Delivery Optimization**

Those that want to take their inventory management practices to the next level will combine inventory data with production schedules to optimize scheduling, cutting down and paying for deliveries only when they are needed.

##### **Predictive Procurement**

Masters of inventory automate as many of the manual procurement steps possible. By integrating Zira to procurement systems like SAP or Oracle, you can run a procurement process end-to-end, starting with inventory data submitted by team members through delivery and shipment verification.
