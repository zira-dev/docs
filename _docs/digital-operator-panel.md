Data collected by machine operators is just as important, if not more, than data gathered from machines and business systems, for understanding and generating insights to make business decisions. Startup checklists, safety forms, quality control checks, even basic production tracking are just some of the traditional paper driven processes that hold and silo critical productivity information and operational health indicators.

Digital operator panels let employees quickly access and submit any digital form in a clicks. Apart from eliminating paper and lost forms, digitizing data collection processes provides benefits to teams in the form of:

##### **Time savings and Accessibility**

Forms are always ready to go. You no longer must decipher different handwriting or spend time moving information into excel or BI systems for analysis. Anyone with the right credentials can instantaneously access information the moment it is submitted.

##### **Automating work orders and tasks**

If a digital form is submitted and indicates that there is a problem or need for service, an email or push notification is immediately sent to relevant team members for review. Alternatively, a task can automatically be opened in Zira or an external work order system with problem details, including who submitted the issue, the time it was reported, and any assigned priority or due date for problem resolution.

##### **Accountability and enforcement**

Just as you can set a trigger to share information that is problematic, you can also set a trigger to notify or create a task when a form has not been completed. This is commonly used for preventive maintenance work or uncommon tasks that have a regular calendar cadence.

##### **Process analysis**

In addition to analyzing information submitted through a form, you can also analyze the form process itself. For example, creating time to completion metrics for different types of tasks helps identify top performers whose methodologies can be learned from by others, or those that are running processes too quickly and should be retrained.
