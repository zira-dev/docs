## *enables teams to make faster decisions with information from operator checklists, inspection, and inventory forms.*
Build a form in minutes and access it from anywhere. Engage and collaborate when it is required.

# Tasks
## *Data and insights mean nothing if corrective actions arenâ€™t taken when a problem or improvement is recognized.*

Assign a task, set a due date, give a priority, and follow along through completion
# Messeges
## *Quickly share information, pictures, and updates in the field or at your desk.*  
Tag team members that should be in the loop.  
Like, comment, and share with ease so people know you are on it.
