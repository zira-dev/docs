## ZIRA vs. Fiix by Rockwell Automation

Zira is built for every member of your facility team to collaborate with machines and increase productivity.  See how it stacks up against Fiix by Rockwell Automation.

Fiix is a traditional computerized maintenance management system (cmms) and a condition-based monitoring solution that enables plant personnel to manage maintenance operations by pulling data, creating reports, and identifying problems.

Fiix can also assist with parts ordering, scheduling of manpower, and planning repairs and downtime.

Unlike Fiix, Zira is a collaborative platform that connects people and machines to business processes such as maintenance, quality control, safety, and production.

Zira leverages artificial intelligence to automate and drive actions through dedicated business process-focused channels. Equipped with a powerful toolset that gets users up and running quickly, Zira ensures that teams keep your machines well-oiled and are continuously working to accelerate business growth.

#### Zira is not just another business software suite. It is designed as a digital virtual workspace, augmenting real-world business interactions and resources. Think of it as a virtual twin of your organization and processes.

### **Why choose Zira over Fiix?**

### **Zira Channels**

You can use Zira channels to automate processes, enable holistic visibility, and collaborate with your teams and third-party contractors in real-time.

Channels can represent anything; create channels that are resource-specific (machines or production line), process-specific (i.e. production or procurement), and even team or customer-specific (maintenance team/customer account/customer order…).

Attaching real-time or manual data sources to channels lets you run analytics and visualizations, create and post scheduled reports, set channel-specific alerts that are triggered by attached data, and set and drive tasks.

Most importantly, channels on Zira allow you to collaborate with your peers or with attached machines by simply ‘following’ a channel and interacting over channel items (posts).

### **Zira Feed**

The Zira feed is where you get updates from all the channels you are following. For example, if you are a maintenance manager, you might follow the maintenance team channel, channels for critical assets you care for, and the procurement channel so you can get updates about spare parts.

From time to time, the feed will suggest updates from channels you might not be following but are important for you or for overall plant productivity. For example, you might not follow the forklift inspections channel, but if there is a safety issue with a forklift that might impact production, it will be pushed straight to your feed so you can take action or participate in resolving the problem.

### **Data Sources**

Connecting your data and applications to channels enables the full automation of business processes and will make your teams unstoppable. Zira supports four types of data sources as follows:

1. Streaming data from sensors, controllers, and devices - connect using built-in drivers for Modbus and many other industrial protocols.
2. Forms - easily design, create and deploy digital forms that allow team members to capture field operational data in real-time. Data acquired by forms is consistent with streaming data and all functionalities, including task and workflow triggers, can be applied to form data. Many teams start acquiring data manually through forms and upgrade to streaming data as they grow.
3. Applications and services - use existing drivers or build your own with the Zira development toolkit to hook your data pipes to business applications and streaming services.
4. ERP, CRM, MES, and many more - two-way connectors to your business applications for a truly automated ‘zero’ maintenance data and execution platform.

### **Task and Workflow Triggers**

Take action immediately, from the feed itself or from any channel. Zira’s integrated tasks and workflows help you automate and track business processes such as maintenance, quality control, safety, and production. Workflow triggers and tasks can be automatically generated based on real-time streaming data, data events, and even channel activity.

Used in conjunction with any type of business or operational data, task and workflow triggers are powerful tools that play a key role in business automation and value realization from data and technology investments.
