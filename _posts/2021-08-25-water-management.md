Water is a key resource used by manufacturers from almost every industry. Whether it is used as a primary ingredient by a beverage producer, for heating and cooling processes at a machinery manufacturer, or driving the cleaning process at a paper production plant, water is a critical and increasingly costly resource that can have ripple effects on the productivity of teams across the factory floor.

Zira’s water management solution is end-to-end and you can start with no upfront costs by gathering water data with digital forms or connecting an existing water meter to Zira. Once water data is on Zira, teams will have all of the familiar Zira tools that allow them to access data, generate insights, communicate, and drive, and reinforce the highest impact actions.

##### **Identify and fix leakage**

You can’t reduce excess water consumption if you don’t know when, where, and how much is being used. Leak detection algorithms on Zira automatically identify leakage and excessive water consumption by comparing your historic water consumption profile, production, and waste data.

##### **Create accurate forecasts**

Access to your plant’s unique demand profile and historic consumption data means you will always secure the right quantity and quality of water for future work.

##### **Manage assets and work**

Water data can tell a story about the health of an asset. If a pump starts pumping less or the return volume from a system changes, it is probably time to prioritize maintenance or inspection.

##### **Calculate ROI before investing**

Using your historic water data on Zira, you can calculate the ROI for investments in machine upgrades or new technologies that will reduce water consumption or improve your system reliability.

##### **Ensure quality**

If a process requires a particular amount or quality of water, you can make sure those specifications are met and enforced when you manage your water on Zira.
