We believe collaboration and data are crucial for winning in today's industrial manufacturing market.  Actually, this is true for any ambitious endeavor, especially those that involve more than one person (or machine).

Team Zira was created to demonstrate how augmenting collaboration with technology, data, and artificial intelligence can make ambitious dreams a reality.

##### "Escape from Alcatraz" Triathlon

The next challenge for the team is the relay race at the ["Escape from Alcatraz"](https://www.escapealcatraztri.com/event-information/overview) Triathlon, taking place on August 15th, 2021.

Team Zira is made up of three participants. Each will participate in one leg of the triathlon. The timing chip acts as the â€œbaton" and is handed off to the next relay team member during the transition.

The Swimmer will be [Uri Nitzan](/about-uri-nitzan-team-zira) and he is responsible for the warm-up transition run from the swim exit to the main transition area.  The cyclist will be [Eran Levi](/zira.team.eran.levi) and he will wait in transition at the relay corral and will receive the timing chip from Uri.   Finally The runner [Haim Gofer](/about-haim-gofer-team-zira) which will wait in transition in the relay corral will get the timing chip from Eran and will finish off the last leg of the race.

In this blog, we will document their training and experiences throughout the year, in training for this event, and becoming fully engaged Zira users.
