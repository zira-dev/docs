We believe collaboration and data are crucial for winning in today's industrial manufacturing market.  Acctualy this is true for any ambitious endverour, especially those that involve more than one person (or machine).

'Zira.team' was created to demonstrate how augmenting collaboration with technology, data and artificial intelligence can make ambitious dreams a reality.  

##### "Escape from Alcatraz" Triathlon

The next challenge for the team is the relay race at the ["Escape from Alcatraz"](https://www.escapealcatraztri.com/event-information/overview) Triathlon, taking place on August 15th 2021.

Zira.team is made up of three participants. Each will participate in one leg of the triathlon. The timing chip acts as the â€œbaton" and is handed off to the next relay team member during transition.

The Swimmer will be Uri and he is responsible for the warm-up transition run from the swim exit to the main transition area.  The cyclist will be Eran and he will wait in transition at the relay corral and will recieve the timing chip from the Uri the swimmer.   Finnaly The runner Haim which will wait in transition in the relay corral for Eran will get the timing chip from Eran and will finish off the last leg of the race.

In this blog we will document their training and experiances throughout the year in training for this event and becoming fully engaged Zira users.
