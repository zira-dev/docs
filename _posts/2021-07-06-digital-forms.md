## Quality Control, Inspections, and OEE with Digital Forms

#### Quality control

Quality parameters that are logged using digital forms will allow notifying in real-time about important incidents, moreover, the communication about the incident will happen within the Zira channel and enable QC persons, operators, and supervisors to immediately act on the subject

Quality parameters will be logged in Zira, searchable, and available in a click. the quality parameters can later be visualized as quality KPIs or charts that show the quality parameters over time.

Display KPIs by facility, machine, operator or shift. trigger task automatically upon new incident

#### OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency)

OEE is a KPI that takes into account three parameters:

* Availability: Availability is defined as `Planned production time - Stop time /Planned production time`
* Performance: The ratio between optimal run time to the actual run-time `(Optimal Time per part × Total parts Count) / Actual total Run Time`
* Quality: the quality defined as `Good parts Count / Total parts Count`

**`OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality`**

bellow example shows an OEE tracking implementation that logs stop time and reason by the machine operator.

We can easily visualize the data and use it in dashboards

#### Pre-shift checklist

The pre-shift checklist is a daily routine done by teams in order to verify a list of parameters related to a specific workstation for all kinds of reasons (Safety, mechanical inspection, working procedures, etc.)

bellow example shows a checklist that logs mechanical parameters of the production line
