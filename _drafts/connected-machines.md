##### COLLECTORS

# Gather (real)time-series data from any source

Harness data from a machine's embedded sensors and PLC, or from external sensors that are installed separately. Ready-to-go collectors are available for the most common protocols (Modbus, 4-20mA, BACnet, etc) and brands (Siemens, Mitsubishi, Schneider, ABB, OSIsoft PI, etc).

##### ANALYTICS

# Visualize data and generate insights on demand

Bring together data from any source, real-time or manual, to create new operational insights and business KPIs. Use prebuilt algorithms from Zira for out-of-the-box analytics or quickly define and deploy your own.

##### DASHBOARDS

# Enable data-driven decision making and performance improvement

Self-service dashboards permit access to any data and insights for any time period. Make any dashboard an “interactive” HMI so operators can run processes and see performance metrics in real-time.
