Die casting is an age-old process that supplies components to traditional and new industries ranging from automotive and housing to renewable energy and robotics. Over time, new technology has been introduced that has enabled machines to produce faster, higher-quality goods, but many of the processes running around those machines are still being driven by pencil and paper.

The benefits that digitizing paper processes can bring to the Die Casting industry are clear, easy to implement, and should be considered essential by any caster hoping to remain competitive in an increasingly data-driven world.

Interviewing maintenance, operations, and general managers revealed the following benefits that switching to paperless processes enables for die casting businesses:

**Reason 1 - Time Savings**

Imagine no more scrambling to find a fresh copy of a form used to record shots, perform a safety inspection, or run a quality audit. Simply search or scan a QR code to pull up the correct form, submit the information required, and move on to your next task. No more lost forms, dropping off paper copies to management, or tedious transcription of data into excel (if that is even done).

**Reason 2 - Visibility and Accessibility**

A timestamp, the form submitter, and any required calculations are automatically applied to form data and available for anyone the moment an operator presses submit. Instant visualizations and trends can be accessed by phone, tablet, or computer, and automated reports and triggers make sure the most important data and insights are pushed to key decision-makers and problem solvers.

**Reason 3 - Enhanced Resource Allocation**

Data is what you do with it. Having key insights and operational metrics pushed the moment they become relevant allow plant leaders to make optimal decisions on where manpower should be expended and how money should be spent. Prioritize training for the machine operator with the lowest average throughput, maintenance for the CNC machine with the highest downtime, and upgrade or add a machine where you can’t keep up with demand.

**1, 2, and 3 Bring the Business Benefits**

So what does more time in the day, visibility and accessibility to data, and enhanced resource allocation mean for your business? Higher productivity and profitability stemming from reduced downtime, increased production throughput, fewer quality control failures, reduced maintenance costs, and faster problem resolution.
