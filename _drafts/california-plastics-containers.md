> ### **_"Zira is a business collaboration platform, like ALL-IN-ONE - twitter, slack and smartsheets. We went from nothing to fully digitized by literally downloading an app. Itâ€™s running our quality, maintenance, and even shipments. Our operational performance is up 400%. "_**

### About California Plastic Containers (CPC)

California Plastic Containers, Inc., is a leader in manufacturing quality blow-molded containers.  From concept to molding and delivery, California Plastic Containers, Inc. is a full-service company that partners with its clients to achieve a common goal at the best possible cost point.

### CPC is a cloud piercer.

Operational excellence is key for profitability and competitiveness in the plastics industry.  Profit margins are razor-thin and customers do not compromise on quality.  This means that production must run as efficiently as possible and raw materials must flow continuously and continuously be monitored for quality on the gram and even micrograms levels.  It also means that all other processes such as delivery and safety must run at the most efficient levels so you can promise and deliver to clients.

That's why California Plastics Containers turned to Zira to improve operations, specifically quality control, shipping, and maintenance.

### Digitizing Quality Control

CPC manufactures injection molded plastic containers.  The raw material (plastic) is extruded from pellets and injected into a mold with multiple cavities.  Each cavity produces one molded plastic container at a time.  Once the mold cools down, the finished product unit drops from each cavity into a large bin.  Quality control measures once an hour weight and thickness of sample units from the bin.

Before Zira this entire process was run manually using pen and paper forms which were then typed into xls worksheet.  It was a wasteful, time-consuming, error-prone manual process.  Furthermore, problems and wasted material due to poor quality and heavy finished goods were abundant but neither shop floor operators nor managers knew about the problems but only after they were analyzed manually by the plant manager which occurred only once a week.

It took less than one day for CPC to completely transform the quality control process with Zira.  The entire process is digitized now.  From data acquisition through analytics, anomaly detection, and insights.

### No more errors 

Each digital input is checked upon typing against specific triggers.  Shop floor operators scan a QR code generated by Zira which opens the quality form and drives the quality control process.

### Data is immediately available 

Data is analyzed to detect potential developing problems such as clogged cavities or miscalculated machine setpoints which waste raw materials throughout the production process.  Monitoring dashboards with links to take action are created and automatically updated accessible by anyone with the right security credentials, on their phones, tablets, and desktops.

### But it doesn't end with a dashboard.

Zira self-service dashboards are dynamic by nature and continuously updated to hold the most recent data, but are also shareable and collaborative.

Anyone in the facility can share a dashboard (including the view they are looking at right now) and add information, pictures, comments.  The share is done directly on a channel which is where everyone can follow and get updates about everything that is happening right now.  A channel can be also specific to a business process and across functions and resources in the facility (for example, a maintenance channel).
