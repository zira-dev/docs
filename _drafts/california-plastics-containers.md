> ### **_"Zira is a business collaboration platform, like twitter, slack and smartsheets, ALL-IN-ONE. We went from nothing to fully digitized by literally downloading an app. Itâ€™s running our quality, maintenance, and even shipments. Our operational performance is up 400%. "_**

### Miguel Garcia, General Manager

California Plastic Containers, Inc., is a leader in manufacturing quality blow-molded containers.  From concept to molding and delivery, California Plastic Containers, Inc. is a full-service company that partners with its clients to achieve a common goal at the best possible cost point.

### California Plastic Containers is a cloud piercer.

Operational excellence is key for profitability and competitiveness in the plastics industry.  Profit margins are razor-thin and customers do not compromise on quality.  This means that production must run as efficiently as possible and raw materials must flow continuously and continuously be monitored for quality on the gram and even micrograms levels.  It also means that all other processes such as delivery and safety must run at the most efficient levels so you can promise and deliver to clients.

That's why California Plastics Containers turned to Zira to improve operations, specifically quality control, shipping, and maintenance.
