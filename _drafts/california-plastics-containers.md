### About California Plastic Containers (CPC)

California Plastic Containers, Inc., is a leader in manufacturing quality blow-molded containers.  From concept to molding and delivery, California Plastic Containers, Inc. is a full-service company that partners with its clients to achieve a common goal at the best possible cost point.

### CPC is a cloud piercer.

Operational excellence is key for profitability and competitiveness in the plastics industry.  Profit margins are razor-thin and customers do not compromise on quality.  This means that production must run as efficiently as possible and raw materials must flow continuously and continuously be monitored for quality on the gram and even micrograms levels.  It also means that all other processes such as delivery and safety must run at the most efficient levels so you can promise and deliver to clients.

That's why California Plastics Containers turned to Zira to improve operations, specifically quality control, shipping, and maintenance.

### Digitizing Quality Control

CPC manufactures injection molded plastic containers.  The raw material (plastic) is extruded from pellets and injected into a mold with multiple cavities.  Each cavity produces one molded plastic container at a time.  Once the mold cools down, the finished product unit drops from each cavity into a large bin.  Quality control measures once an hour weight and thickness of sample units from the bin.

Before Zira this entire process was run manually using pen and paper forms which were then typed into xls worksheet.
